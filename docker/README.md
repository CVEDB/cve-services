# Using Docker with cve-services

## Setup for Local Development

Use the following steps to build and run cve-services (Node.js app
and Mongo) in docker containers.  Note that the current configurations
are set to run the services in development or staging (testing instance) mode. Note that these commands
must be run from the `docker/` directory.

The docker setup uses an environment defined in `docker/.docker-env.example`
but `docker-compose` looks for this file at `docker/.docker-env`.  The
`docker/.docker-env` file is ignored by our `.gitignore`. This is a
safeguard against developers committing changes to their local docker
environment.

## Setup for Local Penetration Testing

1. Change to the "staging" branch (this branch is used for the public testing instance):
  `git checkout staging`

1. Create your environment file if it doesn't already exist:
  `cp .docker-env.staging-example .docker-env`

2. Run the containers (this will also build the cveawg container from the included Dockerfile):
  `docker-compose up`

3. Populate mongoDB with test data included in "datadump/pre-population/":
  `docker-compose exec cveawg npm run populate:stage`

4. Retrieve the API Key (secret) for test user is stored in “user-secret.txt”
  `docker-compose exec cveawg cat user-secret.txt | grep admin2` \
  Should return: {"username":"admin2@mitre.org","secret":"API_KEY"}

5. Use curl to test the API (be sure to include the correct API_KEY returned in step #5):
  `curl -v http://localhost:3000/api/cve-id \
     -H "CVE-API-ORG: mitre" \
     -H "CVE-API-USER: admin2@mitre.org" \
     -H "CVE-API-KEY: API_KEY"`

## Try It Out

To make a REST request to the running CVE services, use the following
`curl` command:

  `curl http://localhost:3000/api/org`

## To shell into the web app server

  `docker-compose exec cveawg /bin/sh`

## To use curl to add a CNA

  `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name": "MITRE Corporation","short_name": "mitre"}' \
     http://localhost:3000/api/org`

## Using Mongo Express

You can use [Mongo Express](https://github.com/mongo-express/mongo-express)
(a mongo web UI) to view mongo from your browser.
To start Mongo Express you can start it with the following command:

  `docker run --network docker_cve-services -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER=docdb -p 8081:8081 mongo-express`

You can use Mongo Express to view the Mongo data by using the
following URL and viewing the *cve_dev or cve_stage* databases:

  <http://localhost:8081/>
