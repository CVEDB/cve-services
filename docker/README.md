# Using Docker with cve-services

## Setup

Use the following steps to build and run cve-services (Node.js app
and Mongo) in docker containers.  Note that the current configuration is
set to run the services in development mode. Note that these commands
must be run from the `docker/` directory.

The docker setup uses an environment defined in `docker/.docker-env.example`
but `docker-compose` looks for this file at `docker/.docker-env`.  The
`docker/.docker-env` file is ignored by our `.gitignore`. This is a
safeguard against developers committing changes to their local docker
environment.

1. Create your environment file if it doesn't already exist:
  `cp .docker-env.example .docker-env`
2. Pull the lates images from [cveservices-dev](https://github.com/orgs/CVEProject/packages?repo_name=cve-services) package:
  `docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/cveservices-dev:latest`
3. Run the containers:
  `docker-compose up`

## Try It Out

To make a REST request to the running CVE services, use the following
`curl` command:

  `curl http://localhost:3000/api/cna`

The result should be an empty JSON array (since there are no CNAs in
the database yet):

  []

## To shell into the web app server

  `docker-compose exec cveawg /bin/sh`

## To use curl to add a CNA

  `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name": "MITRE Corporation","short_name": "mitre"}' \
     http://localhost:3000/api/cna`

## Using Mongo Express

You can use [Mongo Express](https://github.com/mongo-express/mongo-express)
(a mongo web UI) to view mongo from your browser.
To start Mongo Express you can start it with the following command:

  `docker run --network docker_cve-services \
     -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER=docdb -p 8081:8081 mongo-express`

You can use Mongo Express to view the Mongo data by using the
following URL and viewing the *cve_dev* database:

  <http://localhost:8081/>
